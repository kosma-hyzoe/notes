New shortcuts and features to memorize and learn regularly. If it's here it
hasn't become "obvious", an instinct, yet.

## Vim

* `vip`

## grep

* -h - skip file names
* -l - print names only
* -n - prefix with line numbers

## Unix

* `|&` for piping 0 1 and 2
* `mkdir -p music/{rock/{punk,goth},classical/{baroque,early}}`
* `find . -type f -name '*.gz' -exec rm {} + `
* `chmod` files recursively: `find -name "*.sh" -exec chmod u+x {} \;`
* `ls -1A`
* `grep -l`, `grep -n`
* `find . -name "*.md" -exec grep "foo" {} +`
