## Vim 
One way is to use the "gv" command to reselect the last selected text, then use "v" to start visual mode and "o" to switch between the start and end of the selection.

Another way to achieve similar functionality is to use the "zf" command with a motion. For example, to widen the selection, you can use "zf%", which creates a fold that includes the entire file and then "zo" to open the fold. To narrow the selection, use "zf%", then "zc" to close the fold.

You can also use the "v" command to start visual mode and then use "o" to switch between the start and end of the selection.

You can also use the "v" command to start visual mode and then use "O" to switch between the start and end of the selection and repeat it to expand the selection.

The key to efficient use of Vim is to learn and use the commands that suit your workflow the most. You can also use different plugins that provide similar functionality to the JetBrains IDEs.

Keep in mind that Vim can be highly customizable and with time, you can create your own mappings and commands that suit your workflow and make your editing experience even more efficient.
